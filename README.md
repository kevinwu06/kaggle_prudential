# Kaggle Prudential Life Insurance Assessment 
This repo contains the code for my best performing submission to the competition. The script folder contains 3 scripts and 1 support file. [preprocess.py](https://github.com/kevinwu06/kaggle_prudential/blob/master/script/preprocess.py) cleans up the data and does some basic feature engineering including one hot encoding categorical features. [cross_validate.py](https://github.com/kevinwu06/kaggle_prudential/blob/master/script/cross_validate.py) was used to run internal CV on different versions of the model. [xgb_prudential.py](https://github.com/kevinwu06/kaggle_prudential/blob/master/script/xgb_prudential.py) is the code for the model I chose to submit.
